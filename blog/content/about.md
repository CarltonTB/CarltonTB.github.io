Hi, I'm Carlton. I've been a software engineer since 2017 with a broad interest in building useful technology for the world. To date, my professional work has primarily focused on FinTech, while my academic interests are in deep reinforcement learning. My goals for this blog are to write about what Iâ€™m learning, document my personal projects, and express my thoughts on important issues in software engineering and technology.
